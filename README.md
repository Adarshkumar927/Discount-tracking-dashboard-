Every festive season, companies eagerly roll out attractive discounts, hoping to boost sales and generate massive revenue. But here’s the hidden truth — without proper analysis, these discounts can turn celebration into loss. Many businesses unknowingly reduce their profit margins while chasing short-term gains. That’s where our Discount Analysis Dashboard steps in — a data-driven solution designed to uncover the real impact of discounts. Through visuals like the Monthly Discount Trend (Line Chart) and Profit Margin vs Discount (Scatter Plot), it reveals which discounts drive success and which silently drain profits.
